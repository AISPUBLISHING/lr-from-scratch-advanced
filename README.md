Course description
Are you ready to start your path to becoming a Machine Learning expert! 
Are you ready to train your machine like a father trains his son!
A breakthrough in Machine Learning would be worth ten Microsofts." -Bill Gates
There are lots of courses and lectures out there regarding logistic regression. This course is different!
This course is truly a step-by-step. In every new tutorial we build on what had already learned and move one extra step forward and then we assign you a small task that is solved in the beginning of next video.
We start by teaching the theoretical part of concept and then we implement everything as it is practically using python
This comprehensive course will be your guide to learning how to use the power of Python to train your machine such that your machine starts learning just like human and based on that learning, your machine starts making predictions as well!
We’ll be using python as programming language in this course which is the hottest language nowadays if we talk about machine leaning. Python will be taught from very basic level up to advanced level so that any machine learning concept can be implemented.
We’ll also learn various steps of data pre processing which allows us to make data ready for machine learning algorithms.
We’ll learn all general concepts of machine learning overall which will be followed by the implementation of one of the most important ML algorithm “Logistic regression”. Each and every concept of logistic regression will be taught theoretically and will be implemented using python.
Machine learning has been ranked one of the hottest jobs on Glassdoor and the average salary of a machine learning engineer is over $110,000 in the United States according to Indeed! Machine Learning is a rewarding career that allows you to solve some of the world's most interesting problems!
This course is designed for both beginners with some programming experience or even those who know nothing about ML and Logistic Regression!

This comprehensive course is comparable to other Machine Learning courses that usually cost thousands of dollars, but now you can learn all that information at a fraction of the cost! With over 50 HD video lectures and detailed code notebooks for every lecture this is one of the most comprehensive course for Logistic regression and machine learning on Udemy!

We'll teach you how to program with Python, how to use it for data pre processing and logistic regression! Here a just a few of the topics we will be learning:
Programming with Python
NumPy with Python for array handling
Using pandas Data Frames to handle Excel Files
Use matplotlib for data visualizations
Data Pre processing
Machine Learning concepts, including:
Training and testing sets
Model training
Model Validation
Logistic regression with sk-learn
Logistic regression from absolute scratch
Implementing logistic regression on different data sets
and much, much more!
